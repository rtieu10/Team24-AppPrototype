Sarah is a college senior attending a private Liberal Arts college in New York. She works under a tight budget because she has taken out student loans to support her education. As a college Athlete, Sarah is not only prone to injury but also always on the go and never finds the time to search for affordable services. Everyday Sarah enjoys going on morning runs before class. On Monday, while running Sarah slipped on ice and sprained her ankle. She decided to buy painkillers over the counter and try at-home remedies to treat her injury. As this injury began to affect her ability to play on her team, she decided to seek medical attention after a couple days and asked her friends for recommendations on cheap health service providers in New York.

The quest for information about in-network services provided by the school motivates Ojok to frequently check the college website. However, Ojok always finds the information on the website confusing with many complex terms.  

#### User story #3
Grace is a young adult that moved from California. She recently graduated from college and now works in a city a few hours from home. Beyond visiting a personal care provider, she isn’t quite aware of which specialists she should visit, and which ones would have access to her medical records. In the past, her parents dealt with the details of scheduling appointments and covering costs, but now that she lives on her own, the terminology and ambiguity in how much a visit will cost discourages her from visiting most doctors.
